## Fundamentals of GitOps

This article provides a structured overview of GitOps, **an operational model** that uses **Git** as the **single source of truth** for managing infrastructure and application deployments. It explains GitOpsâ€™ core principles, which enhance **consistency, automation, and reliability** in cloud-native environments.

Also, it outlines the **key benefits of GitOps**, demonstrating its **relevance in DevOps and cloud-native ecosystems**, particularly in areas such as **CI/CD, scalability, and disaster recovery across cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP**.

Additionally, it presents a comparison of popular **GitOps tools**, analysing their strengths in terms of **use cases, scalability, automation efficiency, and security features**. Finally, the article introduces **best practices for GitOps implementation**, ensuring **scalable, secure, and efficient deployments in modern cloud-native infrastructures**.

Inspired by the knowledge gained from this article, **I am currently implementing a proof-of-concept project aimed at driving the deployment of a production-ready solution for containerized web applications**. This initiative focuses on **deploying applications on Kubernetes infrastructure** using GitOps, **leveraging ArgoCD** for **automated synchronization and management**.
